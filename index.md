## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Slydite/DC-guide/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Slydite/DC-guide/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### FAQs

** Where do my files get uploaded? **
They dont! DC++ is peer-to-peer, that means all files are stored on users computers. When you download a file from DC++, the file is moving from the shareing computer to yours. Simmilarly, when you share files, only a list is sent over the network. Anyone downloading your files gets them directly from your drive.

** Is DC++ safe **
Yes. DC++ files are ones shared by your seniors and batchies.
Also, only folders you shared explicitly are acsessable to others.

** What is DC++ used for? **
Any big files! Scice using it doesnt consume any of your 10gb per day limit, you can download huge amounts of movies, show, anime, games, courses, and much more. Share any ones you have on you, or just download and enjoy!

** Is DC++ monitored by BITS **
No! As it is peer-to-peer, BITS has no control over the files shared or downloaded. So go crazy!

** Are there alternatives **
Yes! Notable examples are AirDC++, ApexDC++, and EiskaltDC++
Their interfaces are slightly different, but are all simmilar.

** What about Mac or Linux **
Yes, you can run DC on theese platforms. AirDC++ and EiskaltDC++ are both cross-platform and very usable
