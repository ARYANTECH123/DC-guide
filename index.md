## DC++ Instructions

1)	Download EiskaltDC++   
        [Windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/eiskaltdcpp/files/Windows/)  
        [Mac](https://sourceforge.net/projects/eiskaltdcpp/files/Linux/)  
        [Linux](https://sourceforge.net/projects/eiskaltdcpp/files/Linux/)  
        **[`Note:` There are other alternatives available which might be better, you can find themn in the FAQs]**

2)	Install and open it.
3)	Go to **Tools** > **Preferences**(at the bottom). Alternatively, press **Ctrl+O**.
4)	In Preferences, go to **Sharing** and add any content you have by **right clicking** in the **view**(white space on the right) and selecting **Add. Minimum 25GB.**    
    `IMPORTANT:` **If you do not have any content, fear not**. Just add any random folder(s) with 25GB or more content(On windows for example, the **“Program Files”** or **“Windows”** folders should suffice). Please read instructions written after point 8 if you choose to do this.

5)	Close the preferences window and go to Hubs > Favourite Hubs. Alternatively, press Ctrl+U.
6)	In the view, press right click and click on Add New. 
7)	Enter the Name (DeZire Pilani), Address(hub.dcpilani.tk), Nick(Choose any name you would like to have) and User description( Description of content you shared earlier). You may enable Autoconnect on startup.

8)	There, you are done! Now help your friends/wingies install it, make sure to share this link. Continue to read **How to Use**

`If you do not have 25GB of files to upload:` You can try and upload random files and folders(As many as you want). ALternatively, **Windows** and **Program Files** in your C: drive will suffice but do note that these carry a privacy concern and Windows might not even let you share them in the first place. If you choose to do this, as soon as you get access to DC++, you have to download 25GB of content from another user and in this [google form](https://forms.gle/NsT7SRp5nSgqpCUX8), list the content and the users you downloaded from. This is so that we can have some redundancy and to allow the other user to host other data instead. 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
